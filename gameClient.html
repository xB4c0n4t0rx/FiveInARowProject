    <h1>Implementation notes</h1>

    <h2>Introducing gameserver.js</h2>

    <p>
    This client is meant to work with gameserver.js.  This is a 
    simple mechanism to pass information among multiple players
    (as many as you want.)  The gameserver.js is a bare-bones 
    webSocket server.  
    </p>

    <p>
    gameserver.js requires node.js and nodejs-websocket.  Use npm to 
    install nodejs-websocket if it is not currently in your build.
    Be sure to change the URL to the server where your game server is
    located.  Of course you'll need to run gameserver.js through node
    before communication will work.
    </p>

    <h2>Using gameClient.js</h2>
    <p>
    In addition to the server, there is a simple object called
    GameClient included in the gameClient.js.  Instantiate this object
    (for sake of documentation I'll call the instance gc) when the page
    loads.  The constructor will require the URL of the running 
    js file (for example: 
    <code>ws.http://localhost:8001/gameserver.js</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
    The GameClient class has the following methods:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GameClient(url)</strong>
          constructor. Takes the url of a running gameserver.</li>
      <li><strong>connect()</strong>
          connects this client to the server</li>
      <li><strong>sendMessage(key, value)</strong>
          sends state data of this client to the server.
          key is an identifier for this client, and value
          is any string value (can be CSV or JSON string)</li>
      <li><strong>close()</strong>
          closes the connection to the server.  Connection can be 
          re-opened with another connect() call</li>
      <li><strong>getState(message, searchKey)</strong>
          Utility function for finding the state string associated
	  with a client key. Returns state string associated with
	  the key or an error message.</li>
      <li><strong>getKeys(message)</strong>
          Utility that returns all client keys associated with 
	  the message. Returns an array of strings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Required Functions in the Client HTML</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>init()</strong>
          Does not need to be called init, but some sort of initialization
	  needs to instantiate the GameClient class and connect to the
	  server.</li>
      <li><strong>getMessage(text)</strong>
          Automatically called whenever any clients are updated
	  text is the message string (also stored in stateData.)
	  Use this function to respond to an update if you need 
	  anything more than lookups.  You should overwrite this
	  function even if you aren't going to use it, just to 
	  avoid errors. 
	  </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About stateData</h2>
    <p>
    Every time a connected client updates, the getMessage() function
    of each client is triggered, passing a message string as a 
    parameter.  This message string consists of a multiline string,
    one line per client.  The string begins with the client key 
    followed by a pipe character and the rest of the character string
    </p>

    <p>
    Including the gameClient.js file also provides access to the global
    <code>stateData</code> string, which is automatically updated on 
    every data
    refresh. You can access this string directly if you wish (though
    you should not change it directly.)  It is easier to use the 
    convenience functions <code>getKeys()</code> to get an array of
    client keys in the system, and the <code>getNode(key)</code> 
    function to retrieve the data (normally position and state data)
    associated with a particular key.
    </p>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>
    Note there is absolutely no security in this system.  All data is
    passed as trusted data, so it's up to you to make sure it does what
    it's supposed to do. There is also no checking for dropped clients,
    so a dropped client will simply freeze.  You may want to put some 
    client-side code to check for this.
    </p>
